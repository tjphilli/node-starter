## The Problem
Have you ever been sending a Snapchat from the bathtub and frustrated by the fact that your friends aren’t in the bath too? We sure were, and that’s why we made Bathchat. Bathchat combines everything we love about Snapchat with everything we love about being in the bath. Some of your most contemplative moments are in the bath or shower, but there is no way to guarantee that your friends share that pensive context. There’s literally nothing worse than sending a ruminative snap from the bath to a friend, only to receive a superficial selfie from their walk to class. Ephemeral communication apps are in style, but we wanted to elevate the puerile discourse of Snapchat-like apps, to a more introspective and earnest tenor representative of the bathing state of mind. Bathchat solves this problem.

Bathchat works by geofencing baths approved by our team. You can only send and receive Bathchats if you are in a registered bath.  Registering new baths is incredibly easy. You simply take a picture of your bath and upload it to the system, and since Bathchat requires location services be turned on, when we approve the bath those geo-coordinates are added to the system. We approve baths by asking the question, “Is this photo of a bath?” when we receive new submissions. If the answer to the question is “yes”, then we approve the bath. If the answer to the question of whether it is a bath is “no”, the bath is not approved. Good news, the Bathchat bath registry is global, so baths are relative to the whole system, not just users. So if you’re spending the weekend at a friend’s house who is an avid Bathchat user, their bath will be an approved bath as well.

If you’re not in the bath and you get a Bathchat, sorry pal, you can’t open it yet! But Bathchat alerts the user that there are new chats pending with a push notification that reads: “You’ve received a new Bathchat! Hop in the nearest tub to view.” This maintains engagement with users by creating anticipating and anxiety. The user will think, “What am I missing? Who sent this to me? What neoteric musings await me? I know I showered this morning but another one couldn’t hurt.” An additional positive byproduct of using the app is an increase in personal hygiene, as you really look forward to bathing. Our app icon is reflective of this idea. As a child, you may have been excited for the bath because of the toys you get to play with, like a rubber ducky or those foam blocks that float. This was a clever ploy by adults to make bathing palatable for children. As you mature, the allure of the bath wears off and the pragmatism of bathing becomes its most prominent attribute. Bathchat restores the childlike joy to this process, and it’s why I chose a yellow duck as the icon. Just like as a child you associated an actual rubber duckie with fun and excitement and hygiene, you can again by placing it on your home screen.

## The Project
Our team made Bathchat for the class Software Design & Documentation at Rensselaer. The class was much less about developing a product, and much more about the process around software development. We had to develop personas, user stories, class diagrams, deployment diagrams, and all other kinds of fun stuff, in addition to making a software product as our final project. I designed Bathchat and directed product development throughout. Bathchat was my vision, and I was excited to be able to realize it though the class.

For the purposes of the class, we pared down our eventual feature set, but we got much of it working. I focused a lot of time thinking about what a Bathchat actually is. It should have familiar Snapchat-like abilities to modify photos before sending, especially since you’re in the tub! With Bathchat, it’s easier than ever to censor NSFW elements of your photos you want to send. Simply tap to place a duckie over sensitive imagery, or drag with your finger to blur something. This allows for low-friction censorship by users of their photos, but hey, if they don’t want to censor the photos, that’s up to them as well.

Whenever I explained Bathchat to a friend, they were instantly hooked on the idea. Sometimes, they would say, “man, you guys are going to be rich”. Besides the fact that developing a product for a class precludes it having a business model, I felt this sentiment was antithetical to the core values of Bathchat. I would say to them, “No, Bathchat will always be free. **Bathchat is for the people**.” And that became the refrain for the product, and ultimately our guiding vision. *Bathchat is for the people.* So much so, that when we had to identify our “Project Stakeholders” in one of our papers, my team member Theo simply had a numbered list with only “1. The People”. There was no number 2.

There were a number of things worth quoting from the assignments we turned in for class. Here is an excerpt from our Product Review #2 discussing the brand:
> The wordmark—Bathchat—communicates important brand values. Note that the product may be referred to only as "Bathchat" and not as anything else, including "BathChat" or "Bath Chat." In the current climate of software development, documenting and validating identity and product design decisions is integral to product success and the easy addition of team members, especially for a mobile application.

In the end, Bathchat was wildly successful. Our professor loved it, and said ~~he could see himself using it~~ he could see why people would want it. Our TA loved it too, and all of our friends we showed it to are waiting with anticipation for the final release. We managed to get our minimally viable product working on our phones, registering new baths, enforcing the geofences, and sending and receiving Bathchats. It was a smash hit.
## Why is this in my portfolio?
You may be thinking, “Why did he include this in his portfolio?” and that is a valid thought to think. Initially, Bathchat was just kind of idea I joked about; I thought of it more as a satirical art piece than a product I’d ever consider making. It’s the sort of thing I’d make a joke landing page for, but making the entire thing would be excessive. But the constraints for Software Design &amp; Documentation were perfect for Bathchat to become reality, as we had to make a software product, and our school would own a portion of the app had a business model, so we were told explicitly to not make a commercial piece of software. My friends convinced me to take the class as it would give us all an opportunity to learn more iOS development, as we were new to it at the time. In the end, even though I don’t do much low level programming, working with object-oriented design patterns and stuff was beneficial to me, and it gave me an excuse to realize my dream of making Bathchat.

*Bathchat: it’s for the people*.
