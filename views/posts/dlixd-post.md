**Note:** These are my initial thoughts and very rough concepts for this project. Placeholder text represents specific content not yet fully written. 

For my thesis project, I’m analyzing hundreds of digital products, collecting and curating specific details, and cataloging them in a web and companion mobile app. I had the idea for this project talking to a friend about how I collect and organize visual inspiration. I explained that I use EmberApp to save stuff from websites, and even screen recordings of attention to detail in mobile apps, to support related work I might do or just to serve as general inspiration/stimulation. My friend suggested I do something to make specifically the videos available to people, and after thinking on it I realized it could be useful.

Basically, the sorts of things I’m searching for and collecting are delightful details of digital products. A lot of these are animations and really nice interactions, but some of them are just evidence of a designer’s intense attention to detail. These are things that surprise and delight users, and when executed well, make a product more fun and rewarding to use—even more human in a sense. Below are some examples of small details that can make an interface more visually interesting and help people relate to a product.

## The Project

When I first started doing these screen recordings, part of it was also a way to ensure an archive of some of the interfaces and interactions I really admired. Even things that weren’t necessarily ideal for users still had beautiful or admirable qualities and aesthetic value. I never got a chance to record Carousel by Dropbox’s original “flick” interface and that makes me sad when I think about it, as now they employ a more practical albeit less beautiful approach to having people send photos.

What I’ll be doing is as I collect hundreds of these tiny details I’ll post them online. I have the initial concepts for the site, but I’ll be building a whole web application to support the project, so that I have complete control. I’ll be able to categorize and tag details, offer analysis, and make available the videos for download so others can use them as a resource as well.

    <div class="caption">Eventually I want people to have more capable search features but for now I'm relying on categories/tags</div>
  </div>
</div>

The project will also give me an opportunity to think critically about the use of specific animations and interactions in design. Are the animations helpful? Are they communicative in some way? Or are they purely ornamental?

	</div>
	<div class="caption">Please excuse the hipster ipsum, for now.</div>
</div>


I’ll be analyzing the the most commonly used animations and places for delight, like refresh-spinners and easter eggs at the bottom of TableViews. I hope to gain an understanding of how animation and attention to detail in an interface can help soften the barriers between humans and technology and make products feel kinder and more emotive.

I’ll also be creating a companion iOS app that embodies the spirit of the project in its approach to interactions.
