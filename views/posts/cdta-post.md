Working for Troy Web Consulting, I redesigned the website of the Capital District Transportation Authority as a response to a request for proposal they sent to us, along with a lot of other companies. The RFP stipulated that the responses should take a “mobile-first approach” and should be a responsive site. I worked with [Zach Temkin](http://zachtemkin.us) to develop our response, and the more we considered their customers and what they were asking for, we realized the project was not going to simply be a typical responsive site. In fact, visitors coming from a mobile device had very different priorities than that of desktop users, so the site should cater to those differing priorities, since they correspond to different physical contexts. We explained all of this, and more in our response, which is available for download below.

The response from CDTA was very positive. We received an opportunity to do a phone interview with them, which went well and resulted in an in-person interview, and we were one of only three companies selected.  They appreciated our consideration of the project, since we went a different direction from what the RFP specifically asked for. We also only submitted one design even though they asked for three, since Zach and I felt strongly that it was more important to iterate and revise our concept than it was to arbitrarily come up with two additional designs we didn’t feel necessary.

In terms of division of labor, it was very collaborative. He focused more on mobile and I focused more on desktop, but ultimately in terms of interaction design decisions we both offered a lot of input on the other’s work. The majority of time spent on the project was pacing around a room talking, and white boarding. The document we submitted to CDTA that got us interviews is below in its original form. We haven’t modified it since, even though it’s a little rough around the edges since it was written on very little sleep. Don’t mind the overuse of “eschew”.
