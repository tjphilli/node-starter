## The Problem
Have you ever been sending a Snapchat from the bathtub and frustrated by the fact that your friends aren’t in the bath too? We sure were, and that’s why we made Bathchat. Bathchat combines everything we love about Snapchat with everything we love about being in the bath. Some of your most contemplative moments are in the bath or shower, but there is no way to guarantee that your friends share that pensive context. There’s literally nothing worse than sending a ruminative snap from the bath to a friend, only to receive a superficial selfie from their walk to class. Ephemeral communication apps are in style, but we wanted to elevate the puerile discourse of Snapchat-like apps, to a more introspective and earnest tenor representative of the bathing state of mind. Bathchat solves this problem.

If you’re not in the bath and you get a Bathchat, sorry pal, you can’t open it yet! But Bathchat alerts the user that there are new chats pending with a push notification that reads: “You’ve received a new Bathchat! Hop in the nearest tub to view.” This maintains engagement with users by creating anticipating and anxiety. The user will think, “What am I missing? Who sent this to me? What neoteric musings await me? I know I showered this morning but another one couldn’t hurt.” An additional positive byproduct of using the app is an increase in personal hygiene, as you really look forward to bathing. Our app icon is reflective of this idea. As a child, you may have been excited for the bath because of the toys you get to play with, like a rubber ducky or those foam blocks that float. This was a clever ploy by adults to make bathing palatable for children. As you mature, the allure of the bath wears off and the pragmatism of bathing becomes its most prominent attribute. Bathchat restores the childlike joy to this process, and it’s why I chose a yellow duck as the icon. Just like as a child you associated an actual rubber duckie with fun and excitement and hygiene, you can again by placing it on your home screen.

## The Project
Our team made Bathchat for the class Software Design & Documentation at Rensselaer. The class was much less about developing a product, and much more about the process around software development. We had to develop personas, user stories, class diagrams, deployment diagrams, and all other kinds of fun stuff, in addition to making a software product as our final project. I designed Bathchat and directed product development throughout. Bathchat was my vision, and I was excited to be able to realize it though the class.
